# Inference engine

An inference engine that implements both forward and backward chaining. It can be found in action on GitHub Pages: <https://cyoq.github.io/inference-engine/>

This was a learning project. Inspirations were taken from the following sources:

- Viewbox tweening: <https://svelte.dev/repl/7a7a8a2a90804516ae20ae37fa243e31?version=3.38.2>
- Tab component: <https://svelte.dev/repl/cf05bd4a4ca14fb8ace8b6cdebbb58da?version=4.2.8>
- D3.js Tree Layout: <https://codepen.io/augbog/pen/LEXZKK>

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Testing can be done with:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
